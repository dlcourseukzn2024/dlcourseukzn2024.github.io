Tensorflow\n","\n","### Question 1\n","Let's review the terminology introduced by thinking about how to design a model for each the following scenarios. It's important to remember that while there is more than one correct answer in these cases, we want to develop an intuition to help save time in parameter tuning, training, computational resources, etc. We'll also briefy touch on some advanced topics to provide a foundation for later in the course, and remember you do not need to use a deep neural network in every case.\n","\n","*Case 1:* The input is the MNIST handwritten digits dataset (features are 28x28 pixel intensities and labels are digits 0-9). We want to predict which digit the image represents and there are only 10 images per category ($N=100$).\n","\n","    -\n","\n","*Case 2:* The identical setup but this time there are thousands of images per category.\n","\n","    -\n","\n","*Case 3:* The identical setup as case 2 but this time images may contain multiple digits or no digits at all.\n","\n","    -\n","\n","*Case 4:*  The covariates are BMI measurements and reported smoking status, the labels are binary denoting cardiovascular disease. Our sample consists of 70 individuals and we want to predict an individuals' health status based on their BMI and smoking status. We are interested in the effect of BMI on cardiovascular disease.\n","\n","    -\n","\n","*Case 5:* The input consists of thousands of images of different animals and we want to classify which animal the image contains.\n","\n","    -\n","\n","*Case 6:* The input consists of thousands of English sentences and we want to predict the next word in the sentences.\n","\n","    -\n","\n","*Case 7:* The input consists of biomarker status for thousands of loci across thousands of individuals (i.e. Ancestry.com). There are no associated labels and we wish to learn about population substructure.\n","\n","    -"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Dq7zh9wM8zvg"},"source":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"XdKVc4HJXHra"},"source":["### Question 2\n","\n","Draw the architecture of a neural network satisying the following conditions:\n","\n","1.
